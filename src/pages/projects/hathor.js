It is an app for musicians to have a deliberate practice session, in which they can have a structured practice with focus on different parts of their playing and fixing any issues while slowing down and focusing on an issue instead of mindlessly going through repertoire.'}
                            problem={'The biggest challenge for musicians learning a new instrument is having a deliberate and effective practice session. Often, a lack of structure results in unproductive practice, where repertoire is played mindlessly without addressing crucial technical issues.'}
                            solution={'Hathor addresses this challenge by providing a tool that helps musicians structure their practice sessions, ensuring they stick to the plan and focus on their specific issues. It operates seamlessly in the background, allowing musicians to maintain their focus without distractions.'}

                                <p class="text-base">While aiming for a minimal and clean design for the app, I also wanted to infuse it with a touch of vitality. Given its artistic nature, the app needed to reflect that essence. I drew inspiration from classic Art Deco designs and contemporary artists like Mads Berg to craft an illustration that embodies this spirit. The character was inspired by a photo of Bill Evans, one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time.</p>

                            You can test the app and its user experience here. Real users have repeatedly tested the user experience, and Iâ€™ve made changes based on their feedback to reach this iteration. The design life cycle is ongoing, with continuous improvements always possible. This project is dynamic and community-driven, so if you have any suggestions, please reach out at hi@sajjaddashti.ir.
